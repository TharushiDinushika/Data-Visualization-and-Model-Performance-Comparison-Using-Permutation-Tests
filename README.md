# Data-Visualization-and-Model-Performance-Comparison-Using-Permutation-Tests
This project analyzes a heart disease dataset using visualization, clustering, and classification to discover patterns and build a prediction model. A permutation test is applied to compare the performance of Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM), identifying the more effective model for predicting heart disease.
